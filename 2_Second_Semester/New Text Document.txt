1. Cloud Computing ML - Grade A
This subject is a cake walk. If you have ever worked with deploying micro services, you will never have a problem.
Please do not take this subject if you want to learn anything good.

Pros 
- You will learn a lot of legacy cloud technologies.
- You will create an extensive de-centralised network 
- This is a capstone course, so better get this one over with early. 

NOTE -  PLEASE TAKE ANOTHER CAPSTONE COURSE BECAUSE PROJECTS REALLY COME IN HANDY WHEN APPLYING FOR JOBS.

Cons 
- There is nothing to learn if you have a general understanding of the cloud technologies.
- The classes are all over the place and you wont get much out of it. (Refer to notes and the class textbook)

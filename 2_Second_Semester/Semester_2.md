1. Cloud Computing ML - Grade A - (Capstone)
Difficulty 1/5
This subject is a cake walk. If you have ever worked with deploying micro services, you will never have a problem.
Please do not take this subject if you want to learn anything good.

Pros 
- You will learn a lot of legacy cloud technologies.
- You will create an extensive de-centralised network 
- This is a capstone course, so better get this one over with early. 

NOTE -  PLEASE TAKE ANOTHER CAPSTONE COURSE BECAUSE PROJECTS REALLY COME IN HANDY WHEN APPLYING FOR JOBS.

Cons 
- There is nothing to learn if you have a general understanding of the cloud technologies.
- The classes are all over the place and you wont get much out of it. (Refer to notes and the class textbook)



2. Operating Systems  - A- - 93.56
Difficulty 4/5

JUST WOW - FRANKEH IS A GENIUS.
This is a mandatory course at NYU and there is no other professor other Frankeh.
Make sure that you have a very good understanding of the C++.

NOTE - DO NOT COPY THE CODE. I THINK HE USES MOSS TO CHECK THE CODE FOR PLAGERISM. THIS MEANS EVERY CODE BRANCH WOULD BE CHECKED INDIVIDUALLY AND IT WILL FOLLOW THE CODE FROM THE MAIN TO THE END. 

Pros 
- The labs are each 1000 lines of code so this needs atleast 3-4 days. Do not start at the 11th hour.
- By the time you complete this class, you will have a very good understanding about the language fundamentals.

Cons 
- The labs are realtively easy but they are very detail oriented. Basically they will teach more about the language instead of concepts themselves.
- The mid terms and final exams are very tough and some of the topics are not even taught in class.
- If you are new to the language there is just no way you can get through this class. 


3. Database Systems   - A  - 99
Difficulty 1/5

This is a relatively easy course. Plan and take it with a difficult course.
This does not have a mid term or a final exam.
This course just has 8 simple homeworks across the duration of 12 weeks.

This is a capstone course emphasizing large-scale database systems. This course studies the internals of database systems as an introduction to research and as a basis for rational performance tuning. Topics include concurrency control, fault tolerance, operating system interactions, query processing, and principles of tuning. Database capstone projects involve topics such as design, concurrency control, interactions, and tuning.

Pros 
- This course will teach you a lot if you want to build a carrer in data science.
- Will learn how to handle large scale DB and data cleansing activities.
- There are only 2 homeworks and an extensive final project. This does not have any additional midterm, final or quizes.

Cons 
- The final project is very extensive. Even if you begin early there is no chance to tell whether it will be finished or not.
- The course is offline and the professor is really strict about the attendance.

This is a capstone course emphasizing large-scale database systems. This course studies the internals of database systems as an introduction to research and as a basis for rational performance tuning. Topics include concurrency control, fault tolerance, operating system interactions, query processing, and principles of tuning. Database capstone projects involve topics such as design, concurrency control, interactions, and tuning.

Pros 
- This course will teach you a lot if you want to build a carrer in data science.
- Will learn how to handle large scale DB and data cleansing activities.
- There are only 2 homeworks and an extensive final project. This does not have any additional midterm, final or quizes.

Cons 
- The final project is very extensive. Even if you begin early there is no chance to tell whether it will be finished or not.
- The course is offline and the professor is really strict about the attendance.

Deducted 4 marks every assignment. Our professor was very strict about the file format and it made no difference. Entire class got a 4 mark deduction. This is a valuable course but I would not recommend taking it with my professor. If you have any doubts, feel free to email - ankit.sati05@gmail.com.

Pros 
- This a good course that would help with a career in data analysis. 
- We learned about Tableu, BI and code labs.

Cons 
- Professor is so stringent of rules that marks would be deducted for a file format twb instead of twbx. If you show 11 projections instead of 8, Marks would be deducted.
- You can learn everything in this course within a week. 
- There is no work on big data sets and everything can be done from a work station.
- Professor promissed access to the NYU Supercomputer but we never got to that part of the course.
- There are no office hours and they ar repeatedly cancelled.

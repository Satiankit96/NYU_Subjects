Grade deduction 
1. Programming Languages (Online) - 
Difficulty - 3/5
Never start HW in the last week. This is too extensive and taxing and will for sure tax your grade. 
HW 1 was scored at 82/100.
After this the midterm preparation suffered due to procedural program. 

P.S - Many student opt for the class of ALexander Alexeeavic. Both classes are good but Prof Cory plock has much taxing Assignments.

2. Algorithm Design (Offline)
Difficulty - 2/5
No point in taking any class except Prof. Doddis.
Straight A
The teaching assistants cannot help you. Read the CLRS book page to page and you will be good.
NOTE - The homeworks are very taxing and you need to begin early. (13 homeworks in total)

3. Heuristic Problem Solving (Offline)
Difficulty - 3/5
One of the best subjects taught by one of the best professors at NYU.(Prof. Dennis Sasha) 
The subject is taxing, and every class is like playing a tournament where you have to create a bot and face the other bots. 
Win and losses will not define your grade but the complexity of the algorithm will.
Have fun and make sure you take his class. 
THE BEST.
LONG LIVE SASHA.

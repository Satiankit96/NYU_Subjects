## K-Means Clustering Project

We used an object oriented design for building the project and used the Stanford NLP library. We implemented K-Means using Euclidean distance, K-means using cosine similarity, K-means++ using cosine similarity. Performed preprocessing of textual data (stop word removal, Punct tokenization, N-grams). Calculated TF-IDF scores which was used to build the document matrix and further clustering. We also performed visualization.

The project can be run on Eclipse IDE. Project has been uploaded as a zip file. Contents of the project:

- BDS-hw2 (Contains source code, resources, and the topics.txt)
- Visualization (Contains screenshots of various parts of the code while running)
- Initial data visualized clustering
